    <h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER I. <br />Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
      the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
      the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
      in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
      conversations?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><s>So she was considering</s></strong> in her own mind (as well as
      she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
      the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting
      up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a <mark>White Rabbit</mark> with
      pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>There was nothing so</u> very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
      it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
      “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
      it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
      time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
      <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and
      then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
      that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or
      a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
      field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
      large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
